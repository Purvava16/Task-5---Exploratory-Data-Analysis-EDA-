# Task-5---Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

Summary – Titanic Dataset EDA
Our exploratory analysis of the Titanic dataset offered some compelling insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic voyage.

Survival Rates:
Overall, only about 38% of the passengers survived. This immediately shows how deadly the incident was. When we looked deeper, we noticed that survival wasn't random — certain groups had a significantly higher chance of survival than others.

Gender Influence:
Gender played a crucial role in survival. Women were far more likely to survive than men. This likely reflects the “women and children first” policy followed during evacuation.

Passenger Class Impact:
First-class passengers had a much better survival rate compared to those in second and third class. This highlights the social inequality present at that time — better class meant better access to lifeboats and help.

Age Distribution:
Most passengers were young adults, but children (especially those under 10) showed slightly better chances of survival. Missing age values were handled carefully to avoid bias in this insight.

Embarkation Port:
The majority of passengers boarded from the Southampton port ('S'). Interestingly, survival rates varied slightly depending on the port, but this was less influential compared to gender or class.

Fare and Wealth:
Passengers who paid higher fares tended to survive more, likely because higher fare often meant better cabins and proximity to help. There's a noticeable correlation between fare and class, and indirectly, with survival.

Missing Data:
The dataset had missing values in a few important columns like 'Age', 'Embarked', and especially 'Cabin'. We used statistical methods to fill in the gaps for age and embarkation port, while the 'Cabin' column was dropped due to excessive missing data.

The EDA helped us understand that survival on the Titanic was not just about luck — it was closely tied to social status, gender, and access. These patterns help tell a deeper story about human behavior and inequality in times of crisis.
